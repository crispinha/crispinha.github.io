I’m interested in using technological methods to create and facilitate artistic works. At the moment I’m mostly working on interactive musical programs that use techniques and algorithms from graphics programming to drive the musical or visual elements. I’m currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Graphics and a Bachelor of Music in Sonic Arts and Music Technology at Victoria University of Wellington, which allows me to study and combine creative and technical practice.

## ECOSYSTEM
ECOSYSTEM is a generative ambient piece built around a visual environment of simulated entities. Each entity, mimicking a fish or a bird, moves with the entities around it, creating flocks and swarms. The overall movement and energy of the environment controls the movement of the synthesis, creating a flowing soundscape connected with the visual elements.

The entites are controlled by the Boids algorithm, and ECOSYSTEM was an opportunity to use techniques from computer graphics in sonic arts.

Premiered at Sounds of Te Kōkī May 2022, created in Max/MSP, filmed by SOUNZ.

## Uncommon Orbit
Uncommon Orbit is an interactive audio-visual composition that combines Brian Eno-style ambient "tape" loops and glitch-type asthetics, working with musical structures like flowing vs rhythmic/pulsed and continuious vs random. Built with p5.js.
