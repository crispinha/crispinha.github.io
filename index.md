My work is in developing technologies to create and facilitate artistic works. My current focus is in development of musical instruments and tools and DSP programming, and I also create interactive musical programs that use techniques and algorithms from graphics programming to drive the musical or visual elements. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Graphics and a Bachelor of Music in Sonic Arts and Music Technology, both from Victoria University of Wellington, and I am currently completing a Bachelor of Music with Honours which allows me to study and combine creative and technical practice.
