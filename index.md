I’m interested in using technological methods to create and facilitate artistic works. At the moment I’m mostly working on interactive musical programs that use techniques and algorithms from graphics programming to drive the musical or visual elements. I’m currently finishing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Graphics and a Bachelor of Music in Sonic Arts and Music Technology at Victoria University of Wellington, which allows me to study and combine creative and technical practice.
