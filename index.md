# Crispin Hitchings-Anstice.

I'm interested in using technological methods to create and facilitate artistic works. At the moment I'm mostly working on interactive musical programs that use techniques and algorithms from graphics programming to drive the musical or visual elements. I'm currently studying towards a Batchelor of Science in Computer Graphics and a Batchelor of Music in Sonic Arts and Music Technolgy at Victoria University of Wellington, which allows me to study and combine  creative and technical practice.
