This was a group project, with a team of one design student and five computer science students. The aim of the project was to create a game in Unreal Engine 5 and to work as a team and explore and develop strategies for working as a team and working remotely/asynchronously. My main work was on the character controller, including character movement, attacking, and health; animation playback; and integration with other game systems.
