## Spatial Composing

As part of CMPO 310 'Electronic Music, Sound Design and Spatial Audio' I have composed several works for spatial audio. I have composed for several different speaker setups, including for speaker hemispheres, [the IKO 20-sided loudspeaker](https://iko.sonible.com/en.html), and combinations of these, using the ambisonics surround format. I have used electronic music and modular synthesis methods to create these compsitions.
