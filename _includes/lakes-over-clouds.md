## Lakes Over Clouds

I had two main goals for this composition. The first was to use a synthesiser I have been building in a complete work. The synthesiser uses modal synthesis, a variant of physical modelling that gives the composer precise control over the harmonics of the notes played. My second goal was to work collaboratively and with a performer in a way that I usually don't. By writing a graphical score and leaving things up to the interpretation of the performer I let go of the precise control afforded by the tools of electronic music, my main medium.

Premiered at Sounds of Te Kōkī May 2024, performed by Estella Wallace, recorded by Joel Jayson Chuah & myself, audio and video production by Kassandra Wang.
