This piece draws from concepts of minimal music, particularly ‘phasing’ as used by Steve Reich and other artists. A short phrase is played against a copy of itself, off set and shifting in time, revealing different interactions between the two phrases — a musical moiré effect. In creating this I studied many works that use phasing, examining how they are structured. I use this research to create a sequencer in the Max programming environment that performs the phasing, and this sequencer is the centre of the live electronics that realise the piece. I composed this piece as part of my Honours study, supervised by Mo Zareei. Finalist in the 2024 Lilburn Trust NZSM Composers Competition. Full EP release forthcoming.
