These are assignments from a course on film composition taught by [David Long](https://www.davidlongnz.com/). The course focused on using and combining sampled, recorded, and synthesised instruments in scoring, developing creative skills and techniques around composing for picture, and the process of scoring for screen both musically and practically.
